simple village cg mini project
 In this project we have implemented an “simple village” so we have given the title as “SIMPLE VILLAGE” where a small house will be present and around it some trees will be there and in the sky, a couple of clouds will be kept on moving in the sky and the sun will be there.

From the trees some birds will fly towards the sky we have designed a set of birds and we made them fly one set after the other to show the motion of some objects and also we have provided motion for the clouds too.

Inside the house, we can turn on the light and turn off the light by the controls provided in the keyboard. There is a night mode in which there will be the dark sky and comets will be moving and the airplane these two objects will appear when the respective control is pressed on the keyboard and the mouse.
